- Who is being empowered by your mapplication?
Answer: Members of the Asian American community in Southern California
- What technical and ethical problems could there be in developing this tool?
1. Protecting the privacy of survey respondents, especially given the story nature of our survey (ex. Identifying information)
2. Diversity of respondents within categories of Asian Americans
3. Getting a satisfactory number of responses for surveys
4. Getting a random/representative sample of participants

-The technology used for the project
 1. Javascript, Google Forms, Google Sheets, Leaflet
 
-How others could use this in the future
 1. One long-term impact we hope to maintain for this project is to create a website that is more accessible to community members within UCLA who face difficulty with reporting their incidences, or who do not feel supported otherwise with discussion their fear/anxiety surrounding increased xenophobia. Language accessibility and translation means that individuals who identity as Asian in the targeted community can garner increased access to user stories that both validate their own perceptions and allow more awareness on the safety of certain areas. This group will be exploring options in giving on-campus Asian American organizations (ex. Pacific Ties Newsmagazine and the Taiwanese Student Association, and more)  the ability to maintain this site to continue the projectâ€™s purpose of empowerment after this session has ended. For example, we hope to partner with student organizations at UCLA to garner more activity for this map, and to pass off this project to these organizations so they can trace sentiments among the community at hand for years to come.
