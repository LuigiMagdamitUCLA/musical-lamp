                Our project aims to listen to and document perceptions of hate and “otherness” among populations of Asian Americans within the UCLA community. We also hope to collect stories and trace changes in general feelings of fear experienced in the daily lives of Asian Americans within the same population. We hope to create a website with a map that marks locations of the Asian American community at UCLA to provide a sense of community in a geographic way. Each marker will include the narrative of the individual participant, alongside base demographic data such as ethnicity. We hope to create a user base whereby participants can self-report feelings of anxiety and fear. By handing this off to various on-campus Asian American-based organizations at UCLA,  the community in discussion may be able to trace their feelings of fear due to racial profiling retroactively before, during, and after the COVID-19 pandemic to highlight any key significant differences., especially since such news is not heavily reported on mainstream outlets in day-to-day life.
